# project-server
These files are from third year of college from a class called "software engineering". This is a small part of a major project where we were in groups of 5 to make a scrum team. We had a stand-up meeting every day and sprints every 2 weeks for about 6 weeks. I worked on the backend of the android app where I created calls using JavaScript to the database, MongoDB, and that would send the info to the app.

I thought this was a good example because it is similar to what I did during the internship except with a different database and platform.
